<h3>House Blend Coffee</h3>
<img src="C:\Users\Hiten\Desktop\house-blend.jpeg" alt="House Blend">
<p>The approach that many successful coffee shops use is to offer a “house blend” which is essentially a straight-forward “all day drinker” that is good on it's own and pairs well with the milk and sugar many customers will inevitably add (this is especially true with espresso, as many single-origin coffees do not favor.</p>

<!--French Roast-->
<h3>French Roast</h3>

<p>This is a category of dark roasted coffee characterized by an intense and smoky-sweet flavor, accompanied by a thin body and mouthfeel. Compared to lighter roasts (like cinnamon light roast coffee, which is highly acidic), French roast coffee is far less acidic and roasted in flavor.</p>

<h3>Columbian Roast</h3>

<p>Colombian coffee also has a dark roast used to make rich espresso blends. Remember that the roast of the coffee isn't actually related to the growth of the coffee. Colombia is famous for its coffee beans, which can be used to make both light roasts and dark roasts.</p>
